# Omar's Bed Leveling Assistant

Video Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K80j13I1RxI

I uploaded this useful G Code script for CR-10 Owners to use to help level the bed. Based on a script by Omar McAdams.

After watching the video of Omar McAdams using his bed leveling gcode for his CR10, then finding that his website was down,  I looked for this code and found it.  

I uploaded this to Github in case anyonw wants to use it.   I have not personally tested this script yet but will do so in the near future.  I will then update this file.
